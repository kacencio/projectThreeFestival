            <h2>What is the Balik-Kultura: <br>Back to Our Roots Festival?</h2>
            <p>Balik-Kultura is a celebration of Filipino culture. 
               Hosted in Daly City, known by Filipinos as "Little Manila," 
               this festival brings together the rich traditions, artistry, 
               and community spirit of the Filipino people. From captivating 
               cultural performances and ancestral crafts to thought-provoking 
               panel discussions, Balik-Kultura offers an immersive experience 
               that honors pre-colonial roots while embracing the modern 
               Filipino identity.
