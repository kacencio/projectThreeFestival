The Balik Kultura Festival is a three-day celebration of pre-Colonial and traditional Filipino culture, taking place from October 3-5, 2025, in Daly City, California. The festival aims to reconnect Filipinos with their rich heritage by highlighting traditions, art, language, and communal values that thrived before colonization.
    
This event is a chance to honor the unique history and identity of the Filipino people while shedding light on how colonization has impacted the way we view ourselves today. Through interactive workshops, thought-provoking discussions, cultural performances, and artistic demonstrations, the festival seeks to foster a deeper understanding of Filipino roots and identity.
    
At its heart, Balik-Kultura is about celebrating the Kapwaâ€”a shared sense of humanity and community that defines Filipino culture. The festival also serves as a space to encourage meaningful conversations about decolonization and the importance of remembering and preserving pre-Colonial history.
    
Mission Statement:
To inspire pride in Filipino identity, educate audiences about our pre-Colonial heritage, and create a platform for exploring Filipino culture in its purest, most authentic form.
    
Proceeds from the event will benefit the Kapwa Kultural Center in Daly City, a hub for preserving and promoting Filipino cultural heritage.
